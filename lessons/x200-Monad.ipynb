Among other things, the AMP proposal added `Applicative` to the Prelude and made it a superclass of `Monad`.\n",

The problem with having this is that `fail` cannot be sensibly implemented for many monads, defaulting to `error` for those cases. As a consequence, you couldn't use `Monad` polymorphic code safely."
