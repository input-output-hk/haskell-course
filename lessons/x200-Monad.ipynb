    "- 2014: \"The Applicative-Monad Proposal (AMP)\" was presented to reconcile the mathematical hierarchy—where every Monad is an Applicative Functor—with the language’s implementation. The key motivation was to reduce code duplication, make Haskell more beginner friendly, and achieve theoretical consistency. The AMP proposal added `Applicative` to the Prelude and made it a superclass of `Monad`.\n",

    "- 2018: \"The MonadFail Proposal (MFP)\" was presented to remove the `fail` behavior from `Monad`. The problem with having this is that `fail` cannot be sensibly implemented for many monads, defaulting to `error` for those cases. As a consequence, you couldn't use `Monad` polymorphic code safely."
